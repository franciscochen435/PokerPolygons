# PokerPolygons

This project explores the implementation of Poker Polygons, a game-like system involving different polygon shapes with specific scoring rules. The focus is on designing an object-oriented structure that categorizes different polygon types, including Triangles, Loose Triangles, and Rectangles, while refining their scoring logic.

A key aspect of the project is introducing an abstract class to manage shared properties and behaviors across polygon variants, improving code modularity. Additionally, the scoring system is modified to incorporate loose scoring rules, which consider additional factors like color to differentiate between different hands.

To ensure the correctness of these updates, test cases are expanded, specifically targeting the newly introduced LooseTriangles and their scoring conditions. The project emphasizes clean architecture, inheritance, and unit testing to create a structured and extensible system for handling Poker Polygons.
